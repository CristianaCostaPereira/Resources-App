## Introduction
App with a list of favorite learning resources and the option of adding or remove new items added.

It has two tabs: one that shows the favorite `Stored Resources` list and the other that allows to `Add Resources` in that list that are more used or more important to the user.

## Setup Project
Clone or fork the project then run:

```
npm install
```

Once all the dependencies have been installed start the development server with:

```
npm run serve
```

## Conclusion
With this project I was able to build a more dynamic and elaborated Vue.js application by practicing Vue features such as components, props, slots and dynamic components.
